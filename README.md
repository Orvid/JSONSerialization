JSONSerialization
=================

A D implementation using meta-programming to automate the (de)serialization to/from JSON. This implementation allows you to simply call ```toJSON(yourObject)```, and get the resulting string, as well as calling ```fromJSON!MyType(input)``` to parse JSON, making the round trip much much simpler.
